Industry Events
---------------

*About*

The Industry Events module allows users with proper permissions to:
 - Add events to the site and apply categories to them.
 - Display a block of upcoming events on the home page or any other page.
 - Display detailed day, week, month and year calendars to users.
 - Provide in-depth information about events linked from the calendars

*Adding events*

Adding an event follows the same procedure as adding any other content item:

1. Select "Content" from the administration menu.
2. Select "Add content" above the list of content.
3. Select "Event" from the list of content types.

 You can then fill in the form. Ensure that you add a summary, which is used in search results and in other content lists.

- Event link -

If the event has a related link (external or internal), you can use this field to add a link. The title field will be the displayed text, while the URL field will be the actual URL of the page.

- Event date -

The Event Date is a required field. You only need to add a start date, while the start time, end date and end time are optional.

- Event attachments -

If you would like to add some supplementary information in the form of an attached document (such as a PDF or Word document), you can upload it here.

- Event type -

Select what kind of event this is. This will enable users to filter different events on calendar pages.

*Publishing the event*

Events need to be put through the workflow just like any other content item. If you have added an event and you cannot see it displayed on the home page or elsewhere, ensure that it has been published.
